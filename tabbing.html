                <p><h2>Collage</h2>
                    Techniques of collage were first used at the time of the invention of paper in China,
                     around 200 BC. The use of collage, however, did not arise until the 10th century in Japan,
                      when calligraphers began to apply glued paper, using texts on surfaces,
                       when writing their poems.
                       [3] Some surviving pieces from this style are found in the collection of Nishi Hongan-jiâ€” many volumes of the Sanju Rokunin Kashu.

                <p><h2>School</h2>
                    A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces
                     and learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers.
                      Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory.
                      [2] In these systems, students progress through a series of schools.
                       The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) 
                       but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers
                        who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught is commonly
                         called a university college or university.</p>

                <p><h2>University</h2>
                    A university (from Latin universitas 'a whole') is an institution of higher 
                    (or tertiary) education and research which awards academic degrees in several 
                    academic disciplines.[1] Universities typically offer both undergraduate and
                     postgraduate programs. In the United States, the designation is reserved for colleges
                      that have a graduate school.</p>
